## Overview

This repository provides minimal working examples for bypassing Cloudflare 1020 errors using Playwright in both Python and Node.js. The focus is on showing basic setups to load pages that are often protected by anti-bot measures. You can find working scripts that help you navigate through these restrictions smoothly.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Python and Node.js.
- **Minimal Setup**: Easy to understand and modify examples.
- **Stealth Plugins**: Use of stealth plugins to mimic human behavior.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Implementation of proxy rotation to avoid detection.
- **Human-like Behaviors**: Techniques to make requests appear more human-like.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install Playwright. Follow the steps below for both Python and Node.js.

### Python Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Playwright:

   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

### Node.js Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 12 or higher).
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. Install Playwright:

   ```bash
   npm install playwright
   ```

## Usage

To use the examples provided in this repository, navigate to the appropriate folder for either Python or Node.js and run the script.

### Python Example

Navigate to the `python` folder and run:

```bash
python example.py
```

### Node.js Example

Navigate to the `node` folder and run:

```bash
node example.js
```

## Examples

### Python Example Code

Here is a basic example in Python to bypass Cloudflare 1020 errors:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")  # Replace with your target URL
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

### Node.js Example Code

Here is a basic example in Node.js to bypass Cloudflare 1020 errors:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://example.com'); // Replace with your target URL
    console.log(await page.title());
    await browser.close();
})();
```

## Improvements

You can enhance your scripts by implementing the following features:

- **Stealth Plugins**: Use Playwright's stealth plugins to avoid detection.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Implement a proxy rotation system to prevent IP bans.
- **Human-like Interactions**: Add random delays and mouse movements to mimic human behavior.

### Stealth Plugin Example

For Python:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from playwright_stealth import stealth_sync

def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    stealth_sync(page)  # Use stealth plugin
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

For Node.js:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { addStealthPlugin } = require('playwright-stealth');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    addStealthPlugin(page);  // Use stealth plugin
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    console.log(await page.title());
    await browser.close();
})();
```
